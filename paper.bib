  abstract = {The spacing effect\textemdash that is, the benefit of spacing learning events apart rather than massing them together\textemdash has been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments, but is not well known to educators or learners. I investigated the spacing effect in the realistic context of flashcard use. Learners often divide flashcards into relatively small stacks, but compared to a large stack, small stacks decrease the spacing between study trials. In three experiments, participants used a web-based study programme to learn GRE-type word pairs. Studying one large stack of flashcards (i.e. spacing) was more effective than studying four smaller stacks of flashcards separately (i.e. massing). Spacing was also more effective than cramming\textemdash that is, massing study on the last day before the test. Across experiments, spacing was more effective than massing for 90\% of the participants, yet after the first study session, 72\% of the participants believed that massing had been more effective than spacing.

  abstract = {Self-regulation of study activities is a constant in the lives of students\textemdash who must decide what to study, when to study, how long to study, and by what method to study. We investigated self-regulation in the context of a common study method: flashcards. In four experiments we examined the basis and effectiveness of a metacognitive strategy adopted almost universally by students: setting aside (dropping) items they think they know. Dropping has a compelling logic\textemdash it creates additional opportunities to study undropped items\textemdash but it rests on two shaky foundations: students' metacognitive monitoring and the value they assign to further study. In fact, being allowed to drop flashcards had small but consistently negative effects on learning. The results suggest that the effectiveness of self-regulated study depends on both the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring and the learner's understanding, or lack thereof, of how people learn.},

  abstract = {Repetition is common in language use. Similarly, having students repeat is a common practice in language teaching. After surveying some of the better known contributions of repetition to language learning, I propose an innovative role for repetition from the perspective of complexity theory. I argue that we should not think of repetition as exact replication, but rather we should think of it as iteration that generates variation. Thus, what results from iteration is a mutable state. Iteration is one way that we create options in how to make meaning, position ourselves in the world as we want, understand the differences which we encounter in others, and adapt to a changing context.},

This book introduces you to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to work together to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Suitable for readers with no previous programming experience, R for Data Science is designed to get you doing data science as quickly as possible. Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund guide you through the steps of importing, wrangling, exploring, and modeling your data and communicating the results. You'll get a complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle, along with basic tools you need to manage the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned along the way. You'll learn how to:  Wrangle--transform your datasets into a form convenient for analysis Program--learn powerful R tools for solving data problems with greater clarity and ease Explore--examine your data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test them Model--provide a low-dimensional summary that captures true "signals" in your dataset Communicate--learn R Markdown for integrating prose, code, and results},

The primary purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to compare the effect of digital flashcards (DFs) and wordlists on learning technical vocabulary as well as to explore students' perceptions regarding the use of DFs. Using convenience sampling method, the study was conducted with a total of 57 undergraduate pharmacy students. Data were collected using a pre-treatment survey, two technical vocabulary tests, and a post-treatment survey. The results indicated that (1) the students learned more technical vocabulary through DFs; (2) their perceptions about the use of DFs to study technical vocabulary were positive; (3) their perceptions of the usefulness of the Quizlet app was a predictor of their success in DF condition; and (4) practicing through digital apps positively predicted their intention to use the Quizlet application. Based on the findings, we concluded that teacher-prepared DFs result in better technical vocabulary learning.},
