Learning all of the functions needed to become proficient in R is a substantial undertaking. Flashcards are a great way to learn the syntax of computer languages (Hermans 2021). The goal of flashr (pronounced "flash-r") is to provide a quick way to view decks of flashcards. 

flashr can use existing built-in flashcard decks hosted at the [flashr_decks GitHub repo](https://github.com/JeffreyRStevens/flashr_decks), including functions and arguments from [R for Data Science, first edition](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and glossaries from several [psyTeachR books](https://psyteachr.github.io/). Check out some [example decks](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr_decks/decks.html).

In addition to built-in decks, you can easily create your own decks using CSV files. This allows you to customize existing decks or create completely new decks. Also, while geared toward learning R, this package can be used to build decks for anything---not just computer syntax!

## Installation

You can install the stable released version of flashr from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=flashr) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("flashr")
```

You can install the development version of flashr like so:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/flashr")
```

## Example

To view, for example, the flashcard deck on data types:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(flashr)
flashcard("data_types")
```

This randomizes the order of terms and give terms before descriptions. If you would like to present descriptions before terms:

```{r eval = FALSE}
flashcard("data_types", termsfirst = FALSE)
```

<img src="man/figures/flashr.gif" alt="GIF of RStudio IDE console showing
the loading of flashr \[library(flashr)\] and the creation of a data
types deck with flashcard('data_types'). The deck opens in the viewer
where terms and descriptions are clicked through.">

## Building decks

To build your own deck, save a CSV file with a `term` column and a `description` column. You can also include a `package` column if you want the package name included with the term and a `title` column if you want to specify the title of the deck.

```{r}
my_deck <- read.csv("inst/extdata/operators.csv")

head(my_deck)
```

Then run the `flashcard()` function on your file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
flashcard("inst/extdata/operators.csv")
```

Check out the [Get Started vignette](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr/articles/flashr.html#creating-your-own-decks) for more details on creating your own flashcard deck.
