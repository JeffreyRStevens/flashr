\description{
This function prints a list of flashcard decks to the console
and let's the user choose one of the decks. By default, the function searches
the \href{https://github.com/JeffreyRStevens/flashr_decks}{flashr_decks repo}.
But other GitHub repos can be used.

To narrow the results, include text in the \code{pattern} argument (for example,
\code{choose_deck(pattern = "r4ds")}).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Choose from all available decks in default repository
choose_deck()

# Choose from decks including text matching pattern
choose_deck(pattern = "r4ds")

# Choose from decks from specific repository
choose_deck(repo = "JeffreyRStevens/flashr_decks")
}
